# CEP

A simple ZIP code seatch built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery, designed to run entirely in the browser.

This project is a browser-based ZIP code search developed for learning and experimentation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). The main goal is to explore file handling, dynamic content rendering, and UI logic in a simple and lightweight web application.
